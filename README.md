## Description of the project

INT - integer, more than just simple numbers.

The ideas behind this project is simple - to capture different ways we learn language and numbers. Why? Because the
way we go about the learning of numbers is easily overlooked. By tapping into how other language teach numbers we
can gain more insights of how we can learn better. Or you may get a few tricks with this app on how you can learn
better visually!
